# 1. Introduction ðŸ‘‹

Hey y'all! I'm Chuong Nguyen a 1st year at Marshall college studying Computer Science with a passion for ML. I've included some of the resources down below that I have used over the course of this project. Feel free to check them out.

# 2. Resources ðŸ“˜

- [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vagnerbessa/average-car-prices-bazil) used in this project
for EDA analysis.


I would like to acknowledge all of sources mentioned below for providing me the resources and opportunities to learn Exploratory Data Analysis and making this project possible.

# 3. Advice ðŸ¤”

- Toy with the code. Experiment with it and see how it works.
- If you read AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron's book, I advise you to do the exercises and organize your code in this repo!
- Tutorial hell is a commonly thrown around phrase describing the difficulties of the wealth of tutorials available to you. Some are confusing. Sometimes there are too many. Some are not comprehensive. Some don't include the information you want. Sometimes there are too many tutorials and it seems as if your progression has been halted. My advice is simply to pick a reliable source. Stick with it. Navigate through other tutorials if needed, but look elsewhere to learn more once you have mastered your fundamentals.
- Start small and work your way up. Start by learning the basics, implementing basic projects. Then, once you've grown comfortable with this cycle, upgrade to more advanced knowledge until you are ready to tackle your project. 

# 4. Ending Note

Making a great project is cool. Making new friends, learning new things, and leaving with curiosity is better. Have fun with the project. Collaborate and meet up. Struggle and learn together.
