# 1. Introduction ðŸ‘‹

Hey y'all! I'm Chuong Nguyen a 1st year at Marshall college studying Computer Science with a passion for ML. I've included some of the resources down below that I have used over the course of this project. Feel free to check them out.

# 2. Resources ðŸ“˜

- [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vagnerbessa/average-car-prices-bazil) used in this project
for EDA analysis.

- [Documentation 1:](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.scatterplot.html?highlight=scatterplot#seaborn.scatterplot) on how to make a scatterplot using seaborn.

- [Documentation 2:](https://matplotlib.org/stable/plot_types/index.html) on how to make different plots using matplotlib.

- [Tutorial 6:](https://designwizard.com/blog/design-trends/colour-combination/) on choosing color palettes for plots.

# 3. Advice ðŸ¤”

- "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." - Thomas Edison. To be successful at the projects you do, to achieve the goals that you set, and to become the person that you want to be, then failure is not option.
- If your studying habit is not working for you, don't continue because doing so will only slow you down.
- To be successful at the goals you pursue takes time and planning. 

# 4. Ending Note

Start small, steady and master the small tasks. Remember that success won't always come on the first try. Always stay positive and be curious.
